# Packages

Geins is a modular platform and the SDK is also modular. The SDK consists of several packages so you don't bloat your application. Each package provides a specific set of functionality that you can use to build your application. 

The following packages are available:

## @geins/core <Badge type="info" text="0.3.6" />
